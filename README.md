# drupal_ajax_on_success

Problem:
I want to call a JS function after a successfull AJAX call.

Code:
- drupal_custom_ajax.module: Contains drupal related code
- drupal_custom_ajax.js: Create post success JS code

Installing:
- Install this module
- Go to /test_page_ajax
- Click the link

If you want to change the post success JS function, open drupal_custom_ajax.js
